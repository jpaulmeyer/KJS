                                      We spoke to many people that have been seeking work for over 6 months. These people are hardworking and highly skilled. However, they often face challenges getting callbacks for
                                 jobs. Many shared with us that they struggle to effectively showcase their experiences. We believe these individuals have the experiences to be successful in many roles 
                                 but could use some help higlighting their past experiences and added value. Our project seeks to
                                    help candidates present themselves in the best way and increase the likelihood they will be interviewed for future roles.
